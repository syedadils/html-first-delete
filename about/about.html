     A year later in 2013, Foodpanda was launched in Bangladesh and Romania.[6][7] With more than 20,000 employees operating in their company, Foodpanda is currently the largest food delivery service in the former country.[6]
     
     In 2014, the service expanded into the Balkans,[7] Brunei,[8] as well as the Philippines.[9] In February 2014, Foodpanda had acquired its main rival in Pakistan, Eat Oye.[10] Global expansion of the Foodpanda business was led by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog and Ben Bauer.[citation needed]
     
     In 2015, cofounder Rohit Chadda stepped down from roles at the company. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or cofounders were present with the company.[11] Its original operation in Indonesia had shut down due to competition with flourishing app-based taxi-motorbike services,[12] while the company sold its Delivery Club business in Russia to Mail.Ru for $100 million in November 2016.[13]
     
     Foodpanda's largest investor Rocket Internet sold the service to Delivery Hero in December 2016.[14][15] On 1 November 2017, Foodpanda re-branded and changed its color from orange to pink with updated logo across all served countries, following its acquisition by Delivery Hero.[16] It had gone through three management changes by 2019.[14]
     
     In April 2018 they left the Brunei market.[17]
     
     From 2019 to 2020, Foodpanda began operating in other markets in Southeast Asia, launching in Myanmar,[18] Cambodia,[19] and Laos.[20] Foodpanda was also launched in Japan in September 2020.[21][22]
