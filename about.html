     In 2015, cofounder Rohit Chadda stepped down from roles at the company. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or cofounders were present with the company.

     Foodpanda's largest investor Rocket Internet sold the service to Delivery Hero in December 2016.On 1 November 2017, Foodpanda re-branded and changed its color from orange to pink with updated logo across all served countries, following its acquisition by Delivery Hero.
